          <p>Foundation models in the vision domain are large machine learning models pre-trained on vast amounts of
            natural images to extract relevant features from their input data. In the ILLUMINATION project, we aim at
            adapting existing foundation models to sensitive medical images, such as CT and MRI data. The challenges
            include ensuring a good performance of the models on medical images and guaranteeing privacy for the medical
            images. Our project addresses the challenges in a joint approach combining competencies from the perspective
            of medical image computing and privacy-preserving machine learning.</p>
